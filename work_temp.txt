Hongqi repo has been updated to the latest. 

As we discussed, we need to enhance the test on Stop API. Here’s some thought in my mind:
1.	We need to test the stop on random timing:
a.	Ensure stop really works: verified through output audio and event.
b.	Ensure no error: check return value, no hanging happen.
c.	Ensure the next speak after stop is success and output is expected.
2.	We need to test the stop on different input:
a.	Using different prosody tag with different pitch, rate and volume.
b.	Ensure the next speak after stop is success and output is expected.
